# project-4-easy-html-tutorial

GA WDI 07 - Project 4 - An easy single-page tutorial for basic HTML and CSS, aimed particularly at young girls.


User Stories:
An easy coding game for kids, directed at girls in particular.
  It will have them build a simple web page based on options presented to them, with the code appearing in the editor as they go along, and the changes to the editor appearing in a view window. (Much like CodePen or GA's Dash, for example.)

  A triple-column layout: tutorial & options / code editor (split horizontally into HTML and CSS views) / the page view.

  It will have a tree of options. Let's start, though, with building a castle. (Option Two, build Your Pet's Web Page!)

When they choose Build A Castle,
  Here are some of the basic options it will take them through:
    - Sky Color - Add Sky
    - Ground Color - Add Ground
    - Castle Wall (Color? Add.)
    - Castle Towers (Color? Add. How Many?)
    - Castle Turrets (Color? Add. Shape? (radio options))
    -  (Flag(s), Moat, Door, Windows, etc.)
    - Banner (Name your castle!)

  When they select an option in the select box, the changes will appear in the code and the pageview. (Stretch goal: ideally with a glow(fade) on the thing that just changed in the code.))

  There will be color selections, shape selections, text-style and text options.

  When they reach the end of the lesson, there will be bonus features like making the turrets glow, the banner wave, or adding color gradients to the divs.
  AND/OR: instructions on how to customize things themselves.

  When they are completely done:
  It will let them take a screenshot of their creation.
  Stretch goal: a button to save the code as html & css files, with instructions of how to open it in a browser attached.

  When they finish, direct them to Scratch, Mozilla Thimble, CodePen, CodeSchool, CodeAcademy, etc. (Also allow page reload.)
